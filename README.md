# Issues

Biggest issue was remembering how to connect to mongoDb Atlas again and 

putting in the correct password and dbname to be able to connect proeprly.

Coding wise had an issue adding all the workouts done together but thanks to 

my instructor he showed a way using virtuals which made everything easier.

Next forgot code to show information in the dashboard I started coding

but forgot to finish the function so it cause a blank page.
